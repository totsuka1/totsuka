## Hi there, I'm Takumi! 👋

- I'm a software engineer with a background in neuroengineering 🧠 and academic neuroscience 🧑‍🔬. I find both neural code and computer code to be fascinating (though the latter is easier to tinker with).

- Currently working as a web-dev at [Lucid Motors](https://www.lucidmotors.com/).

- I'm Japanese-American, and spent a decade in London, but I'm currently based out of NYC 🍎. 

- Away from the computer and the lab bench, I'm an avid reader 📚 and epicurean (wine 🍇 and cocktail 🍸 nerd, especially).

- Questions? Comments? Just want to say hi? [I'd love to hear from you](mailto:takumi.otsuka@gmail.com).
